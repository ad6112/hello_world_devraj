Name: Ananya Devraj 
I am a senior
Major is Economics, Minors are Math & CS as well as Data Science
I've worked with Python for Data Science extensively, as well as Java and the web design languages: HTML/CSS/Javascript
A project I am proud of is being the co-president of Biokind NYU, which is a non-profit that provides data science/analytics solutions for healthcare non-profits in NYC. It's very fulfilling to use data science to make real impact in NYC by providing them with tools that will save hours of manual analytics work.
